<br /><br />
You can install Pvtbox on the server, and it will work as a typical centralized private cloud. Files will be stored on the server only, the device will download files to work offline or just for viewing (Smart sync).
<br /><br />
Also, the file distribution will be executed at the same time from all the devices where the file is located, like in P2P solutions.
<br /><br />
You will get the best from centralized systems - setup easyness and space occupied on the server only. At the same time, you will get the best from P2P systems - high data transfer speed, the ability to create a fault-resistant solution with 1-click multiple data replication. Benefits are not for arguing about, but to be united! ",
